# Intent (v0.1)

Produce: a Daily News Brief that helps a thoughtful reader decide what to pay attention to in 5 minutes.
Audience: curious, time-constrained readers interested in AI, tech, and society.
Success looks like:
- 3 consequential items, clearly framed, not clickbait
- 5â€“7 reputable sources with direct links
- coherent summary and a short "why it matters"
Non-goals: hot takes, hype, ungrounded claims.
Deadline: soft; single-run pipeline.
