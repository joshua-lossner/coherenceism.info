# Enhanced Narration System with Chunking

## Overview
Updated the narration system to handle long content by breaking it into chunks, cleaning markdown, and concatenating audio files.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Text Chunking**
- Splits content into 950-character chunks (conservative limit)
- Breaks at natural boundaries (sentences, paragraphs)
- Prevents word splitting
- Handles any length content

### 2. **Advanced Text Cleaning**
- Removes ALL markdown formatting
- Strips special characters and separators
- Removes code blocks and HTML
- Converts lists to natural speech
- Adds natural pauses for better flow

### 3. **Audio Concatenation**
- Processes chunks sequentially through ElevenLabs
- Adds 200ms silence between chunks
- Creates single seamless audio file
- Direct MP3 concatenation (no external dependencies)

### 4. **Progress Feedback**
- Shows number of chunks being processed
- Displays total duration after generation
- Clear error messages if specific chunk fails

## Technical Details

### Text Processing Flow
1. **Clean Text**: Remove markdown, special chars, formatting
2. **Add Pauses**: Insert natural pauses at sentences/paragraphs  
3. **Chunk Text**: Split into 950-char segments at natural breaks
4. **Generate Audio**: Process each chunk through ElevenLabs
5. **Concatenate**: Combine chunks with silence gaps
6. **Cache Result**: Store final audio with metadata

### Chunk Boundaries
- First priority: Sentence endings (. ! ?)
- Second priority: Paragraph breaks
- Fallback: Word boundaries (spaces)
- Minimum 50% chunk size before breaking

### Error Handling
- Per-chunk error reporting
- 500ms delay between API calls
- Fallback to basic cleaning if LLM fails
- Clear user feedback on failures

## Usage Example

```
Long Journal Entry (5000 characters)
    ↓
Text Cleaning (remove markdown)
    ↓
Split into 6 chunks @ 950 chars each
    ↓
Generate 6 audio segments
    ↓
Concatenate with 200ms gaps
    ↓
Single MP3 file cached
```

## Benefits

- **No Length Limits**: Handle any size content
- **Better Quality**: Clean speech-optimized text
- **Natural Flow**: Proper pauses and breaks
- **Efficient Caching**: Process once, serve forever
- **User Feedback**: Progress indication for long content

## Testing

To test with long content:
1. Navigate to a long journal entry or chapter
2. Use `/speak` command
3. Watch for "X chunks processed" message
4. Verify smooth playback across chunk boundaries

The system now handles content of any length while maintaining high-quality narration!
